# Rust Memory Management Examples

This project demonstrates various memory management techniques in Rust, from basic concepts to advanced patterns. It serves as a comprehensive learning resource for understanding how Rust handles memory allocation, deallocation, and safety.

## üöÄ Features Demonstrated

### Basic Memory Management
- **C-style memory allocation** using `libc`
- **Rust's manual allocation** using `std::alloc`
- **Stack vs heap allocation** patterns
- **Memory layout and alignment** information
- **Smart pointers** (Box, Rc, Arc)

### Advanced Memory Management
- **Custom allocators** with allocation tracking
- **Memory pools** for fixed-size allocations
- **Zero-copy operations** using slices
- **Raw pointer manipulation** and arithmetic
- **Custom smart pointer** implementation
- **Memory alignment** optimization

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. C-style Memory Allocation with libc
Learn how to interface with C memory management functions:
- `malloc()` for memory allocation
- `free()` for memory deallocation
- Memory safety checks in unsafe blocks

### 2. Rust Manual Memory Allocation
Use Rust's built-in allocation system:
- `Layout` for memory layout specification
- `alloc()` for manual allocation
- `dealloc()` for manual deallocation

### 3. Stack vs Heap Allocation
Understand the differences:
- **Stack**: Fast, automatic cleanup, fixed size
- **Heap**: Slower, manual cleanup, dynamic size
- **Box**: Smart pointer for heap allocation
- **Vec**: Dynamic collections on heap

### 4. Smart Pointers
Master Rust's ownership system:
- **Box<T>**: Single ownership, heap allocation
- **Rc<T>**: Multiple owners, single-threaded
- **Arc<T>**: Multiple owners, multi-threaded

### 5. Custom Allocators
Build your own allocator:
- Track allocation statistics
- Implement `GlobalAlloc` trait
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### 6. Memory Pools
Optimize allocation patterns:
- Fixed-size block allocation
- Fast allocation/deallocation
- Memory fragmentation reduction

### 7. Zero-Copy Operations
Minimize memory copying:
- Use slices for data views
- Split data without copying
- Efficient data processing

### 8. Raw Pointer Operations
Work with unsafe Rust:
- Pointer arithmetic
- Memory addresses
- Custom smart pointers

### 9. Memory Alignment
Optimize memory layout:
- Structure padding
- Alignment requirements
- Performance optimization

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

After studying these examples, you will understand:

1. **Memory allocation patterns** in Rust vs C
2. **Stack vs heap allocation** trade-offs
3. **Smart pointer usage** and ownership
4. **Unsafe Rust** for low-level memory operations
5. **Custom allocator** implementation
6. **Memory pool** design patterns
7. **Zero-copy** programming techniques
8. **Memory alignment** and optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

This project includes `unsafe` code blocks that demonstrate low-level memory operations. These are for educational purposes only and should be used with caution in production code. Always ensure that unsafe code follows Rust's safety guidelines.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_tracking_allocator

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

The examples demonstrate various performance trade-offs:
- **Stack allocation**: Fastest but limited scope
- **Heap allocation**: Flexible but slower
- **Memory pools**: Good for frequent allocations
- **Custom allocators**: Can optimize specific patterns
